        <p>During my tenure as a stage manager, I acquired and honed a diverse set of skills that have proven to be invaluable. One of the key skills I developed was time management. Managing rehearsals, coordinating with different departments, and ensuring that everything runs on schedule taught me how to effectively manage my time and prioritize tasks.</p>
        <p>Through my responsibilities as a stage manager, I developed crucial skills in budgeting and fundraising. Managing the production budget taught me to efficiently allocate resources, make cost-effective decisions, and plan for unexpected expenses, providing me with a practical understanding of financial management. Concurrently, my experience in fundraising, which involved event planning, donor solicitation, and relationship building, honed my abilities in persuasion and effective communication.</p>
        <p>Lastly, being a stage manager inevitably involved problem-solving. Whether it was a last-minute cast change, a technical malfunction, or a scheduling conflict, I was often required to come up with quick and effective solutions. This experience has equipped me with the ability to stay calm under pressure and think on my feet.</p>
        <p>Overall, my time as a stage manager was a period of significant growth and learning, during which I developed a versatile skill set that extends beyond the realm of theater.</p>

      <h1>Stage Management Experience</h1>
      <h5 class="padding-32"> I discovered my passion for stage management when I was 12 years old, as I got the opportunity to be the assistant stage manager for a high school production of <u>Rent</u>. I was fascinated by the backstage world, where I could see, hear, and feel the magic of theater. I learned how to coordinate the actors, the crew, and the technical elements, and how to handle the pressure and excitement of live performance. Below is a list of some of the most memorable shows I worked on, and the challenges and achievements I experienced in each role.</h5>
      <p>
        <strong>WillyWonka:</strong> I was the <em>stage manager</em> for the production of <u>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</u>, a musical adaptation of the classic novel by Roald Dahl. As the stage manager, I was responsible for <strong>coordinating</strong> all the technical and artistic aspects of the show, from the pre-production stage to the final performance.

    <h2>
      Some of my main tasks and achievements as the stage manager were:
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I participated in all the <strong>production meetings</strong> from mid-September 2018, where I collaborated with the <strong>producer</strong>, <strong>director</strong>, <strong>set designer</strong>, <strong>costume designer</strong>, <strong>lighting designer</strong>, <strong>sound designer</strong>, and <strong>musical director</strong>. I was the only student in these meetings, and I contributed with my <em>ideas</em> and <em>feedback</em> to the creative process.
      </li>
      <li>
        I assisted in the auditions and casting of the actors, and I attended multiple rehearsals per week from October to December 2018. I checked and reported the attendance of all the actors, and I monitored their progress and <strong>performance</strong>. I also gave them <em>notes</em> and <em>instructions</em> on their cues, blocking, and movements.
      </li>
      <li>
        I selected and trained the <strong>backstage crew</strong>, which consisted of <strong>eight students</strong> who helped with the <strong>set changes</strong>, <strong>props</strong>, <strong>costumes</strong>, and <strong>special effects</strong>. I supervised their work and ensured that they followed the <strong>safety protocols</strong> and <strong>quality standards</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        I <strong>called the show</strong>, which means that I communicated with the <strong>actors</strong>, <strong>crew</strong>, and <strong>orchestra</strong> through <strong>headsets</strong> and <strong>speakers</strong> during the performances. I gave them the <strong>signals</strong> to start and end each scene, song, and act. I also managed the <strong>transitions</strong> between the scenes, and I dealt with any <em>unexpected issues</em> or <em>emergencies</em> that occurred on stage or backstage.
      </li>
      <li>
        I was in charge of the <strong>storage</strong> and <strong>maintenance</strong> of all the <strong>equipment</strong>, <strong>sets</strong>, <strong>props</strong>, and <strong>costumes</strong> after each show. I made sure that everything was properly <em>organized</em>, <em>cleaned</em>, and <em>repaired</em> for the next show. I also kept an <strong>inventory</strong> of all the materials and reported any <em>damages</em> or <em>losses</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
        I adapted to the <em>challenges</em> of working with a <strong>remote set designer</strong>, who was based in Europe and only arrived in New York eight days before the show. We had to coordinate the <strong>design</strong> and <strong>construction</strong> of the sets through <strong>Skype</strong> calls and <strong>emails</strong>, and we had to make some <em>last-minute changes</em> and <em>adjustments</em> to fit the <strong>space</strong> and <strong>budget</strong>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In this role, I learned and developed many <strong>skills</strong> and <strong>qualities</strong>, such as:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Leadership</strong>: I led a team of <strong>more than 30 people</strong>, including actors, crew, and orchestra. I motivated them, supported them, and resolved any <em>conflicts</em> or <em>problems</em> that arose among them.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Management</strong>: I organized and planned all the <strong>logistics</strong> and <strong>resources</strong> of the show, such as the <strong>schedule</strong>, <strong>budget</strong>, <strong>equipment</strong>, and <strong>materials</strong>. I also kept track of the <strong>tasks</strong> and <strong>goals</strong> of each department and ensured that they were completed on time and within the <em>scope</em> and <em>quality</em> expected.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Improvisation</strong>: I was able to <em>think quickly</em> and <em>creatively</em> when faced with <em>unforeseen situations</em> or <em>difficulties</em>, such as when some student actors got locked in the dressing room, the door handle broke, and I suggested they called maintenance to break in, and then we duct-taped the bolt so this wouldn't happen again.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>: I was able to <em>identify</em> and <em>fix</em> any <em>errors</em> or <em>malfunctions</em> that occurred with the <strong>technology</strong>, <strong>equipment</strong>, or <strong>sets</strong> during the rehearsals or the performances. I also prevented any <em>potential risks</em> or <em>hazards</em> by following the <strong>safety measures</strong> and <strong>contingency plans</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Communication</strong>: I communicated <em>effectively</em> and <em>professionally</em> with a <em>diverse</em> and <em>multidisciplinary</em> team of people, both in person and online. I used <em>clear</em> and <em>concise</em> language, and I adapted my <em>tone</em> and <em>style</em> to the <em>audience</em> and the <em>purpose</em> of the message.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Collaboration</strong>: I worked <em>cooperatively</em> and <em>harmoniously</em> with the <strong>director</strong>, the <strong>producer</strong>, and the other <strong>designers</strong> and <strong>artists</strong> involved in the show. I respected their <em>vision</em> and <em>opinions</em>, and I integrated their <em>feedback</em> and <em>suggestions</em> into my work.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>My Experience as a Stage Manager and Prop Master</h2>
    <p>I have been involved in several theater productions, both as a stage manager and a prop master. In these roles, I learned how to coordinate, organize, and create the technical and artistic elements of a show. Here are some of the highlights of my work:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Twelfth Night</strong>: I was the stage manager for this Shakespearean comedy, which had a cast of about 25 actors and a crew of 5 technicians. Sadly, due to covid, we were forced to make our show digital, having each member of the cast film their own videos and the director edited them together. This was a challenging but rewarding experience, as I had to communicate with the actors and the crew online, and ensure that they followed the script, the cues, and the deadlines. I also had to troubleshoot any technical issues that arose during the filming or the editing process.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Grease The Musical</strong>: I was the prop master for this popular musical, which featured a lot of props, such as costumes, accessories, and a full-size car that was rolled on to the stage. Our set designer lived abroad and came over for only one week to build the set, so I had to work closely with him and the director to make sure that the props matched the design and the vision of the show. I also had to supervise the prop crew, who helped me with the storage, maintenance, and transportation of the props.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Xanadu</strong>: I was a member of the backstage crew for this fantasy musical, which had a lot of special effects, such as lighting, sound, and roller skates. There were 7 other people in the crew, and I and one other member of the crew were in charge of everything on stage left. We had to move the sets, the props, and the wires, and make sure that they were in the right place and in the right condition. We also had to assist the actors with their quick changes and their entrances and exits.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Romeo & Juliet</strong>: I was the prop master for this classic tragedy, which required a lot of props, such as swords, daggers, potions, and flowers. This involved going through all the props in the school drama department storage and helping select, identify and place orders to purchase what was missing. I also had to organize all the props to ensure they were ready to go on stage, and label them with the names of the characters and the scenes. At the end of each show, the props needed to be checked and sorted again to be ready for the next show.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are some of the shows that I am most proud of, and that helped me develop my skills and passion for theater. I hope you enjoyed reading about them.</p>

      <h1>The Cult that Made Spoons</h1>
      <h5 class="padding-32">In the summer of 2023, I had the amazing opportunity to participate in the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, the world's largest arts festival, with a UNIS theater group. We wrote and produced an original play called "The Cult that Made Spoons: A Fork in the Road", a comedy about a group of spoon enthusiasts who get involved in a conspiracy. We performed one show in New York, where we received positive feedback and encouragement from the audience and the critics. Then we flew to Edinburgh, where we performed four shows for the public in a small venue. We had to compete with hundreds of other shows, but we managed to attract a decent crowd and make them laugh with our witty dialogue and hilarious situations. We also got to watch some of the other shows and learn from the diversity and creativity of the performers. It was an unforgettable experience that enriched my artistic and cultural horizons.</h5>

    <h5 class="padding-32">To help fund the cost of this trip, which was around $3000 per person, I sold popcorn during the parent-teacher conferences and after school. I made the popcorn myself, using different flavors and toppings, such as caramel, cheese, and chocolate. I also decorated the popcorn bags with catchy slogans and pictures related to our play. I sold each bag for $2, and I managed to raise about $600, which was 20% of the cost of my trip. I was proud of my initiative and entrepreneurship, and I was grateful for the support of my teachers, classmates, and parents.</h5>
